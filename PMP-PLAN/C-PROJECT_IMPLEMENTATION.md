# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware, our group uses the laptop which consists of intel core i5 and 8GB RAM to conduct our project.

#### Software Requirement:
For the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in recognizing car plate and PHP programming language to design the website and database connection. 

#### Intelligent System Architecture:
The proposed neural network is WPOD-Net, which is a type of convolution neural network.

#### Outcomes of the system
2 main steps will be applied in our system, which is license plate detection and character recognition. Given an input image, the first steps are to detect the license plate using Warped Planar Object Detection Network (WPOOD-Net) and regresses one affine transformation per detection, allowing a rectification of the license plate area to a rectangle resembling a frontal view. These positive and rectified detections are fed to an OCR network for final character recognition.
